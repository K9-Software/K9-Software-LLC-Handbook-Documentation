## Serial System

-   Rule 1 The algorithm will replace - with * which will times all the parts of the serial by the part that comes after it, the last part will be divided by 7 then The algorithm takes the output and divides it by 356 and if the number is negative, The algorithm will make it positive.
    
-   Rule 2 The algorithm divides the number by 2 to give us the result; if the result exceeds 71, The algorithm subtracts 71 to get the final result.
    
-   Rule 3 if the first number of the final result is 2 then if the second number is not 3, it unpacks the file.
    

explaining the 10000=30, 10000/2=5000, 5000/71=70.42253521126761 (the number of resets)

## Inverted Serial System

Multiplying it by 71 would cancel all the complete resets, then multiplying it by two gives the last number calculated before the reset, subtracting that number from the original number and then dividing it by two would give you the number b.
